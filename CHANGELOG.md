# Changelog

All notable changes to engram. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); engram uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Critical: `knit setup` was registering the MCP server with args
  pointing at the DEPRECATED `@piyushdua/engram-dev@latest` package.**
  Three source files (`src/commands/setup.ts`, `src/generators/settings.ts`,
  `src/mcp/server.ts`) still hardcoded the legacy scoped name — sed missed
  them during the v0.6.0 rename because the path-style `@piyushdua/engram-dev`
  string wasn't covered by the `engram-` pattern. Now all three correctly
  reference `knit-mcp@latest`. Anyone who ran `knit setup` between v0.6.0
  and v0.6.1 has a broken MCP registration that runs deprecated code; they
  should re-run `npx knit-mcp@latest setup` after upgrading.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-18

Metadata-only republish. No code changes.

### Fixed

- **npm README indexing.** v0.6.0's published metadata had `readme: ""` and
  `readmeFilename: null` in the registry — the README.md was correctly
  included in the tarball but the registry's indexed `readme` field was
  empty, causing the npmjs.com package page to render without the long-form
  content (badges, tool tables, install instructions). v0.6.1 republishes
  to force the registry to re-index README.md alongside the rest of the
  metadata.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-18

**Headline: project renamed from `engram` to `Knit`.** This is a breaking change.

### Why

The npm registry already had two prior-art packages in the same product
space — `engram-mcp` (engram-ai / danielwhyte.com, "MCP server for Engram:
persistent memory for AI") and `engram-ai` (mareo.ai, "small explicit memory
layer for AI agents"). Launching publicly under the `engram` name invited
trademark questions and positioned this project as a clone. With zero
external users today, the cost of renaming is at its lowest.

`Knit` is the new brand — it suggests the actual product mechanic:
sessions knitting together into compounding intelligence.

### Migration for existing v0.5.x users

- **New install command:** `npx knit-mcp@latest setup` (was `npx @piyushdua/engram-dev@latest setup`).
- **Data directory:** moved from `~/.engram/` to `~/.knit/`. Existing data is preserved at the old path — the new code reads from `~/.knit/` and falls back to `ENGRAM_HOME` env var so the migration path works.
- **MCP tool names:** all `engram_*` tools renamed to `knit_*` (e.g. `engram_classify_task` → `knit_classify_task`). 35 tools, all renamed.
- **Settings file:** `_engramHooks` and `_engramOwned` markers renamed to `_knitHooks` / `_knitOwned`. HOOKS_VERSION bumped 3 → 4; the auto-refresh path from v0.5.1 detects any settings.local.json with the old marker and regenerates cleanly via hybrid merge, preserving user-owned hooks and permissions.
- **Subagent files:** `<project>/.claude/agents/engram-<name>.md` → `<project>/.claude/agents/knit-<name>.md`. Path-resolution accepts both prefixes for back-compat reads.
- **Old package on npm:** `@piyushdua/engram-dev` will receive a `npm deprecate` notice pointing to `knit-mcp`.

### Changed

- Package name: `@piyushdua/engram-dev` → `knit-mcp`.
- CLI binary: `engram-dev` → `knit`.
- Repository: `github.com/PDgit12/engram` → `github.com/PDgit12/knit`.
- All 35 MCP tools renamed `engram_*` → `knit_*`.
- Env vars: `ENGRAM_HOME` → `KNIT_HOME` (legacy `ENGRAM_HOME` still honored).
- Settings markers: `_engramHooks` / `_engramOwned` → `_knitHooks` / `_knitOwned`.
- Generated CLAUDE.md markers: `<!-- engram:start -->` → `<!-- knit:start -->`.
- Sidecar filename: `.claude/ENGRAM.md` → `.claude/KNIT.md`.
- Internal types: `EngramConfig` → `KnitConfig`; `ENGRAM_MARKER_*` → `KNIT_MARKER_*`.
- Internal functions: `writeEngramHooks` → `writeKnitHooks`; `spliceEngramBlock` → `spliceKnitBlock`; `engramRoot` → `knitRoot`.
- Worktree slug prefix: `<repo>-engram-<team>-<ts>` → `<repo>-knit-<team>-<ts>`.

### Internal

- 299 tests still pass after the rename — no behavior change, only identifier rename.
- Sed-driven mechanical refactor across 50 source/test files; targeted Edits for back-compat regexes that accept both `knit-` and `engram-` prefixes.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-05-18

Audit-fix patch. Five doc drifts, two real code fixes, one new test file.

### Changed

- **README.md** — header `32 MCP Tools` → `35 MCP Tools`; added the four
  tools that were missing from the tool tables (`engram_prune_sessions`,
  `engram_install_agent`, `engram_set_protocol_strictness`,
  `engram_get_protocol_strictness`); test count `181 tests` → `295 tests`.
- **CLAUDE.md** — Phase Status: `latest → v0.4.1` updated to `v0.5.1` and
  added v0.4.2 / v0.5.0 / v0.5.1 release entries; Domain 2 (Engine) file
  list now includes `protocol-guard`; Domain 4 (MCP) tool count `33` → `35`;
  Domain 5 (QA) test count `272` → `295`.
- **src/engine/protocol-guard.ts** — `from 'fs'` → `from 'node:fs'` and
  `from 'path'` → `from 'node:path'`. The only file in src/ using bare
  module names instead of `node:*` prefix.
- **src/generators/settings.ts** — replaced two silent `catch (e) {}` blocks
  in the Protocol Guard PreToolUse hook with `console.error` logging.
  Previously a malformed `protocol-config.json` would silently fall through
  to warn-level with no diagnostic; now operators see why.

### Added

- **tests/cache.test.ts** — direct unit coverage for `maybeRefreshHooks`
  idempotency (per-process Set prevents double-refresh), malformed
  settings.local.json robustness (no crash on corrupt JSON), and
  `detectProjectRoot` cwd-fallback path. 299 tests total (+4).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-18

Upgrade-path fix for the Protocol Guard hooks shipped in v0.5.0. Without
this, existing v0.4.x users would never receive the new hooks — the
`writeEngramHooks` call only ran on first-time `autoInitialize`.

### Added

- **`HOOKS_VERSION` constant** in `src/generators/settings.ts` — single
  source of truth for the emitted `_engramHooks.version` field. Bumped to 3
  for v0.5.0+ (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, classification gate). Anyone
  whose settings file stamps an older version is treated as stale.
- **Auto-refresh on brain load** — `getBrain()` reads the project's
  `.claude/settings.local.json` once per process; if the stored hook version
  is below `HOOKS_VERSION`, `writeEngramHooks` runs to regenerate. Hybrid
  merge preserves user-owned hooks and permissions, only `_engramOwned`
  entries get refreshed.
- Two new tests in `tests/auto-init-hooks.test.ts` cover the upgrade path
  (stale v2 install → v3 with Protocol Guard hooks, user permissions
  survive) and the no-op case (current version untouched).

### Fixed

- Existing v0.4.x installs now auto-upgrade silently on next MCP call. No
  user action required, no `engram refresh` command needed.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

Headline feature: **Protocol Guard**. The engram workflow protocol is now
runtime-enforced via hooks, not just documented in CLAUDE.md. The protocol
went from skippable advice to a structural gate, modelled after the
"make wrong things hard, not just discouraged" principle.

### Added

- **`engram_set_protocol_strictness({ level: "off" | "warn" | "block" })`** —
  configures Protocol Guard behaviour per project. Default on install: `warn`.
- **`engram_get_protocol_strictness`** — reads the current level.
- **SessionStart hook** — drops a session-loaded marker and prints a reminder
  that `engram_load_session` should be the first MCP call.
- **UserPromptSubmit hook** — clears the per-turn classification marker so
  `engram_classify_task` must run fresh on every user turn before Edit/Write.
- **PreToolUse Edit/Write/MultiEdit gate** — reads
  `~/.engram/projects/<hash>/protocol-config.json` and the per-turn marker:
  - `level=off`: hook exits 0 (no checks).
  - `level=warn` + missing marker: prints a stderr reminder, exits 0.
  - `level=block` + missing marker: prints a block message, exits 2 (Claude
    Code refuses the Edit/Write).
- **`src/engine/protocol-guard.ts`** — pure-IO module for the strictness
  config and marker files, unit-tested in isolation.
- **`engram_classify_task` side effect** — every classification call writes
  `~/.engram/projects/<hash>/.classified-current` with the tier + files so the
  gate has something to read. Best-effort: marker write errors never break
  classification.
- **CLAUDE.md "system-reminder override" paragraph** — defends the protocol
  block against the harness's default `"this context may or may not be
  relevant"` wrapper that demotes user instructions to background.

### Changed

- Generator emits two new top-level hook arrays (`SessionStart`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`). The existing hybrid-merge logic in `src/mcp/cache.ts`
  already handles new event types per `_engramOwned: true` tagging — no
  changes needed there.
- Tool count: 33 → 35. Test assertions and metric badges updated accordingly.

### Internal

- New `tests/protocol-guard.test.ts` with 11 tests covering config
  round-trip, marker lifecycle, handler validation, and `handleClassifyTask`
  side-effect behaviour.
- `tests/generators.test.ts` extended with a Protocol Guard hook suite
  asserting the new SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse entries are
  present, tagged `_engramOwned`, and cross-platform.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-18

Metadata-only patch. No code changes.

### Changed

- **package.json description** — dropped stale "20 tools" claim (real count
  is 33 since v0.4.1). New copy describes engram by capability (memory,
  workflow, worktrees) rather than tool count, so it doesn't drift on every
  release.
- **README** — fixed broken npm version badge (was pointing at unscoped
  `engram-dev`, now URL-encoded `@piyushdua/engram-dev` so shields.io
  resolves the real published package). Removed hardcoded `MCP_tools-32`
  badge for the same drift reason.
- **CLAUDE.md** — domain architecture section synced to actual `src/`:
  the `src/adapters/*` domain was fictional (never existed); replaced with
  the real `src/mcp/*` domain (server, handlers, tools, cache). Engine
  file list now lists the real 15 modules.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-17

Built across 4 parallel team worktrees using engram's own team-worktree
feature on itself. Each team owned one domain; the orchestrator merged
their branches back to main, ran integrated gates, shipped.

### Fixed (Team A — Correctness)

- **Agent-prefix wiring bug.** v0.4.0 had `agentsForRole()` returning
  unprefixed names (e.g., `typescript-pro`) while installing files as
  `engram-typescript-pro.md`. When the orchestrator said "spawn
  typescript-pro", Claude Code's Agent registry looked for
  `typescript-pro.md` and found either the user's own file or nothing —
  engram's personalized file was never invoked. Fixed: `agentsForRole`
  now returns `engram-`-prefixed names; `projectAgentFile` defensively
  strips a leading `engram-` to prevent double-prefixing; the fetcher
  accepts either form internally and looks up the bare name for category /
  URL / bundled-core resolution.
- **VoltAgent attribution gap.** v0.4.0 bundled-core agents had VoltAgent
  attribution (added by `vendor-agents.mjs`), but network-fetched agents
  were cached verbatim with no attribution. Fixed: `fetchAgent` now
  injects the same attribution HTML comment after the YAML frontmatter
  before caching. Both bundled and fetched agents now ship with proper
  upstream notice — MIT compliant.
- **`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`** added at the repo root and shipped in the
  npm package (`package.json` `files:` extended). Lists VoltAgent's
  project URL, license (MIT), pinned SHA, and the full MIT license text.

### Added (Team B — Memory hygiene)

- **`pruneSessionsByAge(rootPath, maxAgeDays)`** in `src/engine/sessions.ts`.
  Atomic temp+rename rewrite. Keeps entries with corrupted dates (we don't
  prove staleness from missing data).
- **`engram_prune_sessions` MCP tool** (tool count 32 → 33). Default 90
  days. Returns `{ kept, pruned, instruction }`.
- **Auto-prune on autoInit.** Fires deferred via `Promise.resolve().then`
  so it doesn't block MCP startup; errors swallowed to stderr.
- **Reflect uses global pool when local is sparse.** `reflect()` in
  `src/engine/reflect.ts` now merges entries from
  `~/.engram/global/learnings.jsonl` when the local KnowledgeBase has
  fewer than 3 entries. Each emitted `Pattern` carries a new
  `source: 'local' | 'global' | 'mixed'` annotation so callers can
  distinguish per-project from cross-project signals.

### Added (Team C — Hybrid hook merging)

- **Three-case `writeEngramHooks`:**
  1. **No file** → write fresh (current behavior).
  2. **File has `_engramHooks` marker** → overwrite (idempotent regen).
  3. **File exists without `_engramHooks`** → MERGE engram's hooks into
     existing user arrays, preserving user entries. Top-level keys
     (mcpServers, permissions) are preserved verbatim. Stale engram
     entries from prior merges (identified by `_engramOwned: true`) are
     stripped and replaced with current ones; user entries untouched.
- **Per-hook `_engramOwned: true` tag** on every entry engram pushes into
  PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop arrays. Claude Code ignores unknown
  fields, so this is purely metadata for engram's own regen logic.
- **`_engramHooks.merged: true`** in the top-level marker on merged files
  to distinguish from engram-owned files.

### Added (Team D — Obsidian export)

- **`engram export obsidian <vault-path>`** CLI command. Walks
  `~/.engram/projects/*/knowledgebase.json` (per-project learnings) and
  `~/.engram/global/learnings.jsonl` (global pool), writes one Markdown
  file per entry into the target Obsidian vault with YAML frontmatter
  (date, outcome, domains, source_project, tags) and inline `#tags`.
- **`<vault>/Engram Index.md`** auto-generated index page grouping
  learnings by tag, linked via `[[wikilinks]]`. Obsidian's graph view
  picks it up automatically.
- **`--filter <tag>`** option to scope export to a specific tag.
- Format argument is `obsidian` only in 0.4.1; structured for future
  extensibility (markdown plain, JSON dump, CSV, etc.).

### Tests

247 → 272 (+25 across the 4 teams):
- Team A added agent-prefix expectation tests, attribution presence test,
  prefix-handling for the fetcher, double-prefix protection for paths.
- Team B added prune coverage (kept/pruned counts, corruption handling)
  and a new `tests/reflect-global.test.ts` for the global-pool path.
- Team C added merge-mode tests (preserves user entries, strips stale
  engram entries, preserves top-level keys).
- Team D added a new `tests/export.test.ts` covering Obsidian export with
  seeded learnings + filter scoping.

### Process note (engram eating its own dogfood)

This release was built by spawning 4 parallel Agent calls with
`isolation: "worktree"`, each handling one domain in an isolated git
worktree. They committed their work to their branches; the orchestrator
merged each branch back to main, ran integrated gates, shipped. Same
team-worktree feature engram v0.4.0 exposed for users — used on engram
itself, proving the workflow round-trips.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-17

VoltAgent subagent integration with engram personalization. Closes the gap
where engram referenced agent names by string but didn't install them — fresh
users now get specialized subagents on first MCP call, no manual setup needed.

### Added

- **VoltAgent subagent integration.** Engram knows which curated agents from
  [github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents)
  (MIT-licensed) match each domain role and project stack. On first MCP call,
  engram installs them into `<project>/.claude/agents/engram-<name>.md` so
  Claude Code's Agent tool finds them automatically.
- **Project personalization layer.** Each installed agent has the VoltAgent
  base prompt plus a marker-wrapped `<!-- engram:context:start --> ... <!-- engram:context:end -->`
  block with project name, stack, high-fanout files, recent relevant
  learnings (filtered by agent role), false positives to suppress, and the
  engram MCP tools the agent can call.
- **Three-tier fetch strategy.** Bundled-core agents (6 files in the npm
  package: `code-reviewer`, `security-engineer`, `qa-expert`, `typescript-pro`,
  `python-pro`, `golang-pro`) install with zero network. Specialized agents
  fetch from VoltAgent at a pinned SHA on first need and cache at
  `~/.engram/agents/cache/<sha>/`. Subsequent installs are local-only.
- **`engram install-agents` CLI command.** `--all` installs every known
  agent (not just project-needed); `--refresh` re-fetches from network even
  if cached. Useful for sandboxes, offline-then-online transitions, and CI
  prep.
- **`engram_install_agent` MCP tool.** Mid-session self-heal: if a team
  references an agent that isn't on disk, the orchestrator can install it
  on demand. Fire-and-forget — returns "queued" immediately, file lands in
  a few seconds for cached/bundled, longer for network fetches.
- **`ENGRAM_OFFLINE=1` env var.** Disables all network fetches. Bundled-core
  still installs; specialized agents surface a clean error pointing the user
  at `engram install-agents` when online.
- **`ENGRAM_AGENT_REGISTRY_REF` env var.** Override the pinned VoltAgent SHA
  (e.g., `main` to track latest, or a different SHA for reproducible builds).

### Changed

- **`scanner.ts::getAgentsForLanguage`** now delegates to the new
  `agent-registry.ts`. The names returned are real VoltAgent names that
  resolve to real .md files (vs v0.3's names that assumed Claude Code had
  agents installed by some other tool).
- **Tool count: 31 → 32** (+`engram_install_agent`).
- **Auto-init flow** now also writes per-project subagents alongside
  CLAUDE.md and `.claude/settings.local.json`. Fire-and-forget so MCP
  startup latency is unchanged.
- **Build script:** `npm run build` now also runs `npm run vendor-agents`
  to refresh `dist/agents/core/*.md` from the pinned VoltAgent SHA. Runs
  automatically on `prepublishOnly`.

### Attribution

The bundled-core agents are vendored verbatim from VoltAgent with an
attribution header (HTML comment after the YAML frontmatter). License:
MIT. Source: github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents at
commit `6f804f0cfab22fb62668855aa3d62ee3a1453077`.

### Privacy

Engram remains local-first. The only network condition is fetching a
specialized (non-bundled) agent on first need. That fetch goes to GitHub
raw, no auth, no cookies, no telemetry. After the first fetch, the agent
is cached and never re-fetched until `--refresh` is passed.

### Tests

201 → 247 (+46). New suites: `agent-registry.test.ts` (registry lookups,
URL composition, bundled-core consistency), `agent-fetcher.test.ts`
(three-tier resolution: bundled / cache / network; offline mode;
error paths with stubbed fetch), `agent-md.test.ts` (personalization,
marker safety, learning relevance filtering).

### Notes

- v0.3.1 (Windows hooks) shipped to git/GitHub but was NOT published to
  npm — its changes ship instead as part of v0.4.0.
- Hybrid hook merging, native Windows shell support beyond the Node-based
  hooks, Obsidian export, and JSONL pruning remain v0.5 candidates.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-17

Cross-platform fix. v0.3.0 hooks worked on macOS/Linux/WSL but silently
failed on native Windows shells (cmd.exe, PowerShell) because they used
unix-only utilities: `jq`, `find -mmin`, `printf '%s'`, `awk`, `sed`, `tr`,
`wc -l`, `tail`, `head`, `grep -qE`. None of those ship by default on
Windows. v0.3.1 rewrites all seven hooks as inline `node -e '...'` scripts
that run identically on every platform.

### Changed

- **All hooks rewritten as inline Node.** Each hook command is now a
  single-quoted `node -e '<script>'` invocation. Node is already an engram
  prerequisite (npm-installable), so no new runtime dependency. Scripts use
  Node's `fs`, `child_process`, regex, and `process.stdin` — all of which
  behave identically across Windows, macOS, Linux, and WSL.
- **Quoting strategy: single-quoted outer, double-quoted inner.** Single
  quotes preserve content literally on bash, zsh, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.
  JS strings inside use double quotes. No escape-character minefields.
- **Embedded paths use forward slashes.** `JSON.stringify(path.replace(/\\/g, '/'))`
  produces a path literal valid in any JS source, on any OS. Node accepts
  forward slashes on Windows too.
- **`_engramHooks.version` bumped 1 → 2.** Lets engram tell a v0.3.0 hook
  set (unix-only) from a v0.3.1 hook set (cross-platform) and regenerate
  cleanly. Existing v0.3.0 users will see their hooks regenerated on the
  next MCP call.
- **Permissions allowlist now includes `Bash(node:*)`** so the hook scripts
  themselves don't bump into Claude Code's command-permission system.

### Affected hooks

- **PreToolUse** Bash git-block — was `jq | grep -qE`; now Node regex over stdin
- **PostToolUse** typecheck on edit (TS/Python/Go/Rust) — was `jq | case`; now Node
- **Stop** build verification — was shell `&&`-chained; now Node sequential `execSync`
- **Stop** session log to `sessions.md` — was bash with `git log | sed`; now Node
- **Stop** sessions.jsonl tuple — was bash with `printf %s`; now Node
- **Stop** LEARN compliance soft reminder — was `find -mmin`; now Node `fs.statSync().mtimeMs`
- **Stop** KB metrics — already Node in v0.3.0, kept

### Tests

197 → 200 (+3): new cross-platform assertions in `generators.test.ts`:
- every hook command starts with `node -e ` (no shell-only)
- no hook contains `jq`, `find -mmin`, `printf '%s'`, `wc -l`, `tail`, `head`, `awk`, `sed`, `tr`
- no Windows backslash-escape patterns leak into embedded paths

Plus a live-fire smoke test confirmed the regenerated session.jsonl hook
runs cleanly via raw `node -e` invocation against a tmp git repo —
identical to how Claude Code would spawn it.

### Notes for v0.3.0 users

Open Claude Code in any engram-managed project. The first MCP call detects
the `_engramHooks.version: 1` marker, regenerates `.claude/settings.local.json`
to version 2, and from that point hooks work on every platform.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-17

Released alongside v0.2's architectural rebuild. Brought forward the items
originally scoped for v0.3 because they're complementary (Model C makes
pattern reflection useful again) and small enough to land cleanly without
delaying the v0.2 surface.

### Added

- **Cross-project learnings pool (Model C)** at `~/.engram/global/learnings.jsonl`. Opt-in: per-project `engram_record_learning` stays primary, but when an insight generalizes beyond the project it was discovered in (e.g., "Stripe webhook signature verification rules"), the agent can call `engram_record_global_learning`. Entries are tagged with the source project's hash + display name.
- **`engram_record_global_learning`** MCP tool — quality-gated like the per-project version; requires summary + lesson + tags.
- **`engram_search_global_learnings`** MCP tool — free-text search over the cross-project pool. Returns matches with their source project so the agent can attribute the lesson. Useful from a fresh project to see what you already know across all your machines' projects.
- **`engram_reflect`** and **`engram_get_suggestions`** MCP tools — back, with sensible guards. In v0.2 these were removed because patterns need ≥3 learnings to be useful and most projects start with one. Model C fixes that: a fresh project benefits from patterns across the global pool from day one.
- **Atomic write for the worktree registry.** Previously `worktrees.json` was written with a plain `writeFileSync`. If two engram MCP processes spawned worktrees concurrently, one could overwrite the other mid-write. Now uses temp-file + atomic rename. Eliminates the race without adding a lockfile dependency.
- **Fix: `.claude/settings.local.json` instead of `.claude/settings.json`** for engram hooks. (Strictly speaking a v0.2 fix discovered during release review, included here.) Teams that commit `.claude/settings.json` are now safe — engram only writes per-machine config to the conventionally-gitignored `*.local.json` file.

### Changed

- Tool count: 27 → 31 (+4: record_global_learning, search_global_learnings, reflect, get_suggestions).
- MCP server header description updated to reflect 31-tool surface and Model C.
- README + CHANGELOG note added about the global-learnings pool being opt-in.

### Tests

182 → 197 (+15). New suite: `global-learnings.test.ts` (15 tests across append, search, recent, count, build, parse-resilience).

### Migration

None needed. The global learnings pool is opt-in — it doesn't exist until the agent first calls `engram_record_global_learning`. Existing v0.2 (or v0.1 → v0.2 migrated) projects keep working unchanged. The version bump is feature-additive, not breaking.

### Still deferred (real v0.4 candidates)

- **Hybrid hook merging.** Currently engram's hook write is all-or-nothing per file. v0.4 should support appending engram's hooks to existing user-defined arrays in settings.local.json.
- **Native Windows hooks.** Stop hooks use bash shell syntax. Most Windows users on Claude Code run WSL, where it works. Native PowerShell support would require rewriting hooks as cross-platform Node scripts.
- **Obsidian export.** `engram export --format=obsidian` writes a vault with one note per learning + sessions as journal entries. Niche, deferred.
- **JSONL pruning.** sessions.jsonl is unbounded; 100 MB read-time guard exists but no automatic pruning. Revisit when a real project hits the limit.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-17

The v0.2 rebuild — engram becomes net-negative on tokens. Memory + workflow + parallel teams unified as one MCP-resident intelligence layer. Nine atomic commits across one arc.

### Added

- **Centralized data path** at `~/.engram/projects/<hash>/`. No more `.claude/` bloat in every repo. Worktree-aware project hash (`canonicalRepoRoot`) so all worktrees of one project share the same brain.
- **Searchable session memory** in `sessions.jsonl`. Two write paths: Stop hook auto-captures structured tuples (date, branch, files, commits), and the agent can opt into a narrative summary via `engram_save_session_summary`. Search across past sessions with `engram_search_sessions`.
- **Workflow on demand** via `engram_get_workflow({phase})`. 14 sections: overview, tier, phases, research, ideate, plan, execute, optimize, review, tdd, learn, handoff, ship, tools. Each is project-config-aware (embeds the project's actual build commands when relevant).
- **Token accounting** in `engram_brain_status.token_accounting`: per-session `claude_md_kb`, `session_count`, `learnings_hit_rate_pct`, plus actionable warnings when CLAUDE.md exceeds 30 KB or hit rate falls below 20 % with > 10 learnings.
- **Hooks wired for real.** Auto-init writes `.claude/settings.json` per project with engram's hook set. Tagged with `_engramHooks` marker for idempotent regeneration; never clobbers a user-curated settings.json (no marker → skip).
- **Marker-wrapped CLAUDE.md.** `<!-- engram:start --> ... <!-- engram:end -->` lets engram regenerate only the engram block, preserving everything else the user wrote. If your existing CLAUDE.md has no markers, engram writes a sidecar `.claude/ENGRAM.md` instead.
- **Parallel team worktrees.** New tools `engram_spawn_team_worktree`, `engram_list_team_worktrees`, `engram_finalize_team_worktree`. Each team works in its own sibling git worktree on a dedicated branch. Multiple agents within a team share the team's worktree. Merge conflicts surface conflict files without destroying work. Compatible with Claude Code's `EnterWorktree({path})`.
- **ENGRAM_HOME env var override** for sandboxed installs and tests.
- **One-shot migration** from legacy v0.1 `<project>/.claude/` data, with `<project>/.claude/MIGRATED.txt` breadcrumb explaining where the data went. No silent loss, no dual-writes.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md generator** rewritten from ~700 → ~100 lines per project (−85 % size). Project-facts-only: name, stack, project map, domain architecture, build gates, tier vocabulary, workflow pointer. The 6-phase protocol depth no longer lives in every project's CLAUDE.md.
- **`$HOME/CLAUDE.md`**: 46.6 KB → 0.5 KB stub. Workflow protocol is per-project + on-demand, not global.
- **Tool description rewrite.** All 27 descriptions trimmed to terse-by-design (avg 90 chars, was 146). Schema JSON: 12,574 → 9,712 bytes (−23 %).
- **Tier vocabulary** added (Inquiry / Trivial / Standard / Complex). Inquiry is new — read-only Q&A skips classification, phases, and LEARN entirely.
- **LEARN inverted from mandatory to quality-gated.** "If session N+1 searched for this tag, would this entry save them time? If no — don't write." Soft reminder hook (`ℹ LEARN was not recorded this session`) instead of the v0.1 enforcement scolding.
- **Plan mode triggers by phase, not by user keyword.** Auto-fires when the agent enters RESEARCH or PLAN. Discussion sessions never enter plan mode by accident.

### Removed

- `engram_reflect` and `engram_get_suggestions` MCP tools — premature with ~1 learning per project. Will re-enable in v0.3 once projects accumulate ≥ 10 learnings. The `reflect()` function itself is kept (still used internally to surface patterns in `engram_load_session`).
- `dash` CLI command — 284 undocumented lines, only imported by `cli.ts`. Removed cleanly.
- `src/adapters/` directory — empty stub claiming Cursor/Codex adapters that never existed.
- `cursor`, `codex` keywords from `package.json` (unsupported clients).
- All v0.1 marketing claims that didn't match the code: "22 project types", "650+ line workflow protocol", "20 MCP Tools" badge inconsistency.

### Fixed

- **Scanner walked $HOME on accidental invocation.** Added macOS home dirs (`Library`, `Caches`, `Downloads`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Movies`, `Music`, `Pictures`, `Public`, `Applications`) to `SKIP_DIRS`. Capped `highFanoutFiles` output at top 15 with `+N more` suffix.
- **Worktree-aware projectId.** v0.1 hashed by absolute path; opening two git worktrees of the same repo produced different hashes (and orphaned brains). Now hashes by canonical repo root via `gitdir` resolution.
- **Stale version strings** in `cli.ts` (was 0.1.9) and `mcp/server.ts` (was 0.1.0) now match `package.json`.

### Tests

111 → 181 (+70). New suites: `paths.test.ts`, `project-id.test.ts`, `auto-init-hooks.test.ts`, `sessions.test.ts`, `workflow-protocol.test.ts`, `worktrees.test.ts`. Test sandboxing via `ENGRAM_HOME` env var — tests never touch the real `~/.engram/`.

### Migration

Open Claude Code in a project that has v0.1 engram data. On the first MCP call, engram detects `<project>/.claude/knowledge.json`, copies all engram files forward to `~/.engram/projects/<hash>/`, and writes `<project>/.claude/MIGRATED.txt` explaining the move. The legacy `.claude/` directory is left intact — delete at your discretion.
